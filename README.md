# Project Overview
At Swift Cart, we pride ourselves on providing a seamless and intuitive shopping experience. However, as our business has grown, so have the challenges. Over the past months, our analytics team has observed a consistent pattern: a significant number of users add items to their carts but fail to complete their purchases. As part of our mission to optimize the customer journey, we’re figuring out to understand the underlying reasons behind cart abandonment and identify actionable insights that can transform these missed opportunities into completed sales.

## Problem Statement
Every day, X numbers of potential transactions are lost at Swift Cart. The data tells a compelling story: The drop-off between cart creation and purchase completion is quite high. The problem is clear—our current checkout process, user interface, or possibly external factors like shipping costs might be causing friction that prevents users from finalizing their purchases.

## Project Goal
Our primary objective is to identify, analyze the factors that lead to cart abandonment at Swift Cart. We will leverage data conclusion to pinpoint friction points in the customer journey and propose targeted interventions that make the checkout process smoother and more intuitive.
## Project End-Users
The findings from this project will serve multiple teams within Swift Cart:
#### Marketing Team:
To refine retargeting strategies and enhance promotional campaigns.
#### Product and UX Teams:
To improve the checkout flow and overall website design.
#### Customer Service: 
To better understand customer pain points and address common concerns.
#### Executive Leadership: 
To inform strategic decisions with data-backed insights on revenue optimization.
### Project Metrics & KPIs
To gauge the success of our interventions and to thoroughly understand the user journey, we will focus on the following key metrics:
#### Cart Abandonment Rate: 
The percentage of sessions where an item is added to the cart but no purchase is completed.
#### Conversion Rate: 
The ratio of sessions ending in a completed purchase to total sessions with a cart addition.
#### Time Spent in Cart: 
The average duration between the first item being added and the checkout process being initiated or abandoned.
#### Drop-Off Points: 
The specific stages in the funnel where the highest percentages of users exit the process.
#### Revenue Impact: 
Estimation of potential revenue loss from abandoned carts and the financial gains expected from conversion improvements.
#### Device-Specific Performance: 
Abandonment rates segmented by device type (mobile, desktop, tablet) to identify usability issues.
### Business Questions
Our analysis is driven by a set of targeted business questions designed to uncover the root causes of cart abandonment:
## Q. What are the critical drop-off points in the checkout process, and at what stage do most users abandon their carts?
## Q. How does the user’s device affect their likelihood to abandon the cart? What could be the potential reasons with devices affecting user engagement?
## Q. What is the impact of applied discounts and shipping costs on the decision to complete a purchase?
## Q. Are there specific user segments or demographics that exhibit higher abandonment rates?

## Executive Summary
SwiftCart abandonment analysis has 6.1K abandoned records with 1.5K Transactions across 2024 shows annual 255.6K revenue.
### Cart Abandonment Drivers:
Changed Mind (56.4%) is the most common reason among 1,304 abandoned sessions, influenced by both internal platform design and external seasonality.
High Shipping Costs (34%) and No Guest Checkout (34%) are the top reasons for abandonment across all devices.
Two month period, abandonment sessions peaked, with the highest rates occurring between weeks 20 and 30 (May to July). This pattern suggests a seasonal effect, particularly during summer sales.
### User Behavior & Engagement:
Users engage actively on the platform, but abandonment peaks after 30 minutes of browsing.
78% of customers prefer shorter browsing sessions (<30 min), yet the platform’s design encourages prolonged engagement.
First two pages retain 79.8% engagement, while engagement drops significantly beyond Page 3.
### Conversion & Discounts Impact:
Discounts significantly impact conversions, with 87.4% of discounted sessions converting versus 27.8% abandoned without discounts.
Bundled discounts drive a 75.2% conversion rate, particularly for carts with up to 4 items.
High shipping costs, especially without discounts, are a key barrier in North America (62.7%), Europe (65.9%), and Asia (58.4%).
### Regional & Customer Segmentation Insights:
North America leads in revenue share (40%), followed by Europe (19%) and Asia (19%), yet also has the highest abandonment rate (40%).
Existing customers generate 75% of revenue, with 6–12 month customers driving $129K in sales.
New signups increased in Q4 (Oct–Dec 2024), with new customers contributing 24% of revenue while showing higher initial engagement.

# Recommendations:
#### 1. Optimize the Checkout Process
Streamline Checkout Flow:

Data indicates significant friction during the checkout process, particularly between the Product Description & Reviews and the Recommendation pages. Simplify the checkout steps by reducing unnecessary form fields and ensuring a clear, intuitive layout. Consider enabling a one-page checkout to reduce drop-offs.
Implement Guest Checkout:

The analysis highlighted “No Guest Checkout” as a key deterrent. Allowing guest checkouts can reduce friction for first-time users who might be reluctant to create an account.
Enhance Order Transparency:

A high percentage of abandonment is due to uncertainty about final order value—especially extra costs like shipping and handling. Clearly display all fees and total order value upfront to build trust and reduce surprises at the final stage.


#### 2. Address Shipping Cost Concerns
Reevaluate Shipping Policies:

High shipping costs are a major reason for abandonment, especially in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia. Consider strategies such as:
Introducing free or subsidized shipping for orders above a certain threshold.
Offering flat-rate shipping or localized shipping promotions to reduce perceived cost barriers.
Clearly communicating shipping fees early in the shopping journey.
Regional Strategy:

Tailor shipping promotions and messaging based on regional data. Since North America has a high volume of abandoned sessions due to shipping costs, targeted offers or partnerships with local logistics providers may yield improvements.


#### 3. Leverage Discount and Bundle Strategies
Targeted Discounts:

The data shows a marked improvement in conversion when discounts are applied. Increase the visibility and availability of discounts—particularly bundled discounts—which have proven effective in driving conversion for carts with up to four items.
Dynamic Discounting:

Use A/B testing to refine discount levels. Experiment with different discount tiers (percentage vs. fixed amount) and monitor their impact on conversion and order value.
Promotional Campaigns:

Coordinate discount promotions with seasonal trends (such as summer sales) when abandonment tends to peak. This can help mitigate seasonal effects and boost conversion rates during high-traffic periods.


#### 4. Enhance Mobile and Multi-Device Experiences
Mobile Optimization:

 Analysis indicates that mobile users tend to spend more time but are more prone to abandon carts. Focus on:
Responsive, intuitive mobile design with simplified navigation.
Faster load times and optimized performance on mobile networks.
Mobile-specific features like larger buttons and streamlined forms.
Cross-Device Consistency:

 Ensure that the experience is seamless across mobile, desktop, and tablet. Consistent UI/UX will reduce friction when users switch devices, leading to improved retention and conversion.



#### 5. Refine User Segmentation and Retargeting
Customer Segmentation:

Dive deeper into customer profiles to identify segments (e.g., new vs. existing customers, device type, region) that have higher abandonment rates. Use this segmentation to tailor marketing and retargeting strategies.


Personalized Retargeting Campaigns:

For customers who abandoned their carts—especially high-value segments—implement retargeting strategies such as:


Follow-up emails with personalized discount offers.
Retargeting ads that remind them of the products in their cart.
Incentives to return and complete the purchase (e.g., free shipping or limited-time discount).


Feedback Mechanisms:

Introduce short, targeted surveys or exit polls at the point of abandonment to capture qualitative feedback. This can help identify hidden friction points and further refine segmentation strategies.
